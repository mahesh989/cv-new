### 3. CV Analysis Templates

#### Primary CV-JD Compatibility Analysis
**Description**: "Primary CV-JD compatibility analysis with strict technical matching"

**Full Prompt**:
```
You are a highly accurate CV assessment agent.

The candidate has uploaded a general CV and provided a job description for tailoring. You must analyze the fit carefully, especially around technical skill requirements.

üß† Important Fit Evaluation Rules

1. Carefully extract all key technical tools, platforms, or languages from the job description
2. If any required technical skills are missing from the CV, mark the fit as "Low"
3. If missing skills are clearly marked "optional", and the CV includes strong alternatives, the fit may still be "Good"
4. Mention each missing required skill specifically in your explanation
5. Do NOT add technologies the candidate doesn't mention in the CV

UPLOADED CV:

JOB DESCRIPTION:
{job_text}

At the end of your evaluation, always include these sections explicitly:

Score: <X/10>
Explanation: <your rationale>
Keywords: <comma-separated list of 10‚Äì20 important keywords from the job description>
Key Phrases: 7-10 (2‚Äì5 words)
```

#### User-Facing Compatibility Analysis
**Description**: "User-facing compatibility analysis with actionable insights"

**REAL-WORLD INTELLIGENCE Section**:
```
UNDERSTAND THE HIRING REALITY:
- Most JDs are wish lists written by non-recruiters
- "Required" often means "strongly preferred" 
- Companies regularly hire people missing 30-40% of listed requirements
- Cultural fit and growth potential often trump perfect skill matches
- Desperate hiring managers are more flexible than JDs suggest

CONTEXT CLUES TO CONSIDER:
- Job posting age (older = more desperate = more flexible)
- Company size (startups more flexible, enterprises stricter)
- Role urgency indicators ("immediate start", "urgent need")
- Market conditions (tech layoffs = stricter, talent shortage = flexible)
- Industry norms (finance strict, startups flexible)
```

**ADVANCED DECISION FRAMEWORK**:

**HARD BLOCKERS (Real deal-breakers):**
- Legal/regulatory requirements (licenses, clearances, certifications)
- Core platform expertise for specialized roles (Salesforce Admin, SAP Consultant)
- Years of experience when role involves managing people/budgets
- Technical foundations that can't be taught quickly (senior-level programming)
- Domain expertise for critical industries (medical devices, financial trading)

**SOFT REQUIREMENTS (Negotiable despite "required" label):**
- Specific tool proficiency when alternatives exist (Jira vs. Asana)
- "Nice to have" skills dressed up as requirements
- Industry experience when skills are transferable
- Advanced certifications in common technologies
- Soft skills that can be demonstrated differently

**LEARNABLE GAPS (Green lights for tailoring):**
- Tool/software proficiency with existing foundation
- Process knowledge (Agile, Scrum when already doing project work)
- Industry terminology and context
- Management responsibilities when leadership is shown
- Advanced features of familiar technologies

**MARKET POSITIONING INTELLIGENCE:**
- Is this a common role or niche specialty?
- How competitive is the talent pool?
- Are requirements realistic for the offered level?
- Do multiple requirements suggest unrealistic expectations?

**COMPANY SIGNALS:**
- Startup language = more flexibility
- Corporate language = stricter requirements  
- "Wearing multiple hats" = they'll train you
- Detailed technical specs = they know exactly what they want

**RED FLAGS IN JD (Usually means flexible hiring):**
- Extremely long requirement lists
- Conflicting seniority levels (junior with senior responsibilities)
- Buzzword soup without clear priorities
- "Unicorn" combinations (full-stack + DevOps + management + sales)

**SOPHISTICATED MATCHING Criteria**:

**LOOK FOR PROOF OF ADAPTABILITY:**
- Career transitions showing learning ability
- Technology adoption patterns
- Problem-solving examples
- Self-directed skill development

**ASSESS SKILL TRANSFERABILITY:**
- Core competencies vs. tool-specific knowledge
- Cognitive abilities vs. learned procedures
- Leadership principles vs. industry-specific management
- Technical thinking vs. specific syntax

**EVALUATE GROWTH TRAJECTORY:**
- Is candidate on upward path in relevant skills?
- Are they positioned to grow into missing requirements?
- Do they show continuous learning patterns?

**REALISTIC DECISION MATRIX**:

üü¢ **STRONG PURSUE (80%+ hiring probability)**
- Meets core competency requirements
- Shows ability to learn missing tools/processes
- No hard blockers present
- Strong cultural/role fit indicators
- Minor tailoring can close remaining gaps

üü° **STRATEGIC PURSUE (40-70% probability)**  
- Missing 1-2 important but learnable skills
- Strong foundation with clear growth path
- Some risk but good upside potential
- Requires thoughtful positioning and tailoring
- Worth pursuing if genuinely interested

üü† **CALCULATED RISK (15-40% probability)**
- Significant gaps but unique value proposition
- Market conditions favor candidate flexibility
- Strong transferable skills from adjacent areas  
- High effort tailoring required
- Only pursue if dream opportunity

üî¥ **REALISTIC REJECT (<15% probability)**
- Multiple hard blockers present
- Fundamental skill set mismatch
- Would require years of development
- Company signals suggest inflexibility
- Time better spent elsewhere

**Output Format**:
```
DECISION: [üü¢ STRONG PURSUE / üü° STRATEGIC PURSUE / üü† CALCULATED RISK / üî¥ REALISTIC REJECT]

MARKET REALITY CHECK:
- What they actually need: [Core 2-3 must-haves vs. wish list]
- Flexibility indicators: [Signs they'll be flexible on requirements]
- Hard blockers identified: [True showstoppers, if any]
- Hiring urgency signals: [How desperate they seem]

INTELLIGENT OBSERVATIONS:
- Hidden strengths: [Undervalued assets in CV that match needs]
- Smart connections: [Adjacent skills that suggest capability]  
- Growth potential: [Evidence of learning ability and trajectory]
- Positioning opportunities: [How to frame existing experience]

REALISTIC ODDS: [X% chance of getting interview if CV tailored well]

IF PURSUING - STRATEGIC PRIORITIES:
1. [Priority 1]: [Most critical positioning change]
2. [Priority 2]: [Key skill/experience to highlight]
3. [Priority 3]: [Important gap to address/minimize]

HONEST BOTTOM LINE: [Straight talk - worth the effort or not?]
