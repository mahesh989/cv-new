### 6. Job Metadata Extraction Template

**Description**: "Extract company information and job details"

**Full Template**:
```
You are an expert at extracting key information from job descriptions and job postings.

Your task is to extract company name, location, and contact information from the provided job description text.

IMPORTANT EXTRACTION RULES:

1. Company Name: Look for these patterns and prioritize them:
   - Company names mentioned after "at", "with", "for", "by" (e.g., "Data Analyst at Microsoft")
   - Company names in headers, titles, or beginning of job posts
   - Well-known company names (avoid generic terms like "Company", "Organization", "Client")
   - Look in contact information, email domains, or website URLs
   - If multiple companies mentioned, choose the hiring company (not client companies)

2. Location: Extract city, state/territory, country
   - Look for patterns like "Sydney, NSW", "Melbourne, VIC", "Brisbane, QLD"
   - Include remote work information if mentioned
   - If multiple locations, choose the primary work location

3. Contact Info: Extract any phone numbers, email addresses, or contact details

EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:
- Be thorough but accurate - don't guess or make up information
- Prefer specific company names over generic terms
- If company name appears multiple times, use the most complete version
- Look throughout the entire job description, not just the beginning
- Consider the context - is this the hiring company or a client mentioned in the role?

Job Description:
{jd_text}

OUTPUT FORMAT (REQUIRED):
Company: [exact company name found, or "Unknown Company" if truly not found]
Location: [city, state/territory if found, or "Not specified" if not found]
Phone: [phone number if found, or "Not found" if not available]

IMPORTANT: Extract the actual company name that is hiring, not client companies mentioned in job duties. Be specific and accurate.
```

## PART 3: LLM-POWERED SKILL COMPARISON PROMPTS (from main.py)

### 7. Intelligent Skill Comparison Prompt

**Description**: "LLM-powered comparison between cached CV and JD skills"

**Full Prompt**:
```
You are performing a comparison analysis between pre-extracted and cached skill/keyword datasets. Your task is to categorize them into matched and missing categories with maximum precision.

## Input Data Structure
You will receive cached results from different sections where each contains data from both CV and job requirements:
- Cached Technical Skills: {technical_skills}
- Cached Soft Skills: {soft_skills}
- Cached Domain Keywords: {domain_keywords}

## Instructions

LLM-Powered Intelligent Matching
As an advanced language model, leverage your understanding to identify:
- Semantic Relationships (e.g., React.js, ReactJS, React â†’ same technology)
- Skill Hierarchies (e.g., "Machine Learning" encompasses "Neural Networks")
- Industry Synonyms (e.g., "Customer Success" = "Client Relations")
- Contextual Equivalents (e.g., "API Development" matches "RESTful Services")
- Transferable Skills, Implied Competencies, Progressive Skills, Related Technologies
- Intelligent Inference: Understand context and nuance beyond exact string matching

For each job requirement, use your language understanding to determine:
- Match Confidence Levels (Exact, High, Medium, Low, No Match)
- Critical Thinking Process (Context Analysis, Skill Relationship Assessment, Practical Equivalence, Gap Impact Evaluation)

### Output Format
Return results in this exact JSON structure:
{
  "matched_technical_skills": [
    { "skill": "...", "match_type": "exact|semantic", "cv_reference": "..." }
  ],
  "matched_soft_skills": [
    { "skill": "...", "match_type": "exact|semantic", "cv_reference": "..." }
  ],
  "matched_domain_keywords": [
    { "keyword": "...", "match_type": "exact|semantic", "cv_reference": "..." }
  ],
  "missing_technical_skills": [
    { "skill": "..." }
  ],
  "missing_soft_skills": [
    { "skill": "..." }
  ],
  "missing_domain_keywords": [
    { "keyword": "..." }
  ]
}

### Precision Rules
- Avoid False Positives (e.g., Don't match "Java" with "JavaScript")
- Handle Ambiguity: If uncertain about semantic match, classify as missing
- Prefer exact matches over semantic matches
- When multiple CV skills could match one job requirement, choose the closest match
- Validation Checks: Ensure no skill appears in both matched and missing categories
- Confirm match_type accuracy (exact vs semantic)
- Special Cases: Technology Stacks, Experience Levels, Version Specificity

## Data
Technical Skills: {technical_skills_json}
Soft Skills: {soft_skills_json}
Domain Keywords: {domain_keywords_json}

Return ONLY the JSON object in the required format.
```
