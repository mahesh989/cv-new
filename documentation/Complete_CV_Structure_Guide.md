## ‚úÖ Perfect! This is exactly what you wanted

I've created a **complete structured CV template** that maintains:
- **Your exact skill descriptions** (not subdivided)
- **Proper JSON structure** with clear sections
- **All standard CV sections** properly organized

## üìã Structure Breakdown

### 1. **Personal Information** 
```json
{
  "name": "Maheshwor Tiwari",
  "phone": "0414 032 507",
  "email": "maheshtwari99@gmail.com",
  "location": "Hurstville, NSW, 2220",
  "linkedin": "LinkedIn",
  "portfolio_links": {
    "blogs": "Medium",
    "github": "GitHub", 
    "dashboard_portfolio": "Dashboard Portfolio"
  }
}
```

### 2. **Career Profile**
```json
{
  "summary": "I hold a PhD in Physics and completed a Master's in Data Science..."
}
```

### 3. **Technical Skills** - **Exactly as you wanted**
```json
"technical_skills": [
  "Specialized in Python programming, including data analysis, automation, and machine learning using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn",
  "Proficient in SQL for querying, modeling, and managing complex relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL",
  "Skilled in creating interactive dashboards and visualizations using Tableau, Power BI, and Matplotlib",
  "Experienced with GitHub for version control, Docker for containerization, and Snowflake for cloud data warehousing",

**Key Points:**

### 4. **Education & Experience** - **Your preferred format**
Both structured exactly as you requested with:
- Clear object arrays
- Consistent fields (`position`, `company`, `location`, `duration`)
- `achievements` arrays for bullet points

### 5. **Additional Sections** I added:

#### **Projects** (extracted from your experience)
```json
"projects": [
  {
    "name": "Data Pipeline Efficiency Optimization",
    "duration": "Jul 2024 - Present", 
    "company": "The Bitrates",
    "description": "Designed and implemented Python-based data processing workflows",
    "technologies": ["Python", "Pandas", "Data Analysis"],
    "achievements": [
      "Improved data pipeline efficiency by 30%",
      "Automated data cleaning and preprocessing tasks"
    ]
  }
]
```

"certifications": [
  {

    "issuing_organization": "Charles Darwin University", 
    "date_obtained": "Nov 2024",
    "status": "Completed",
    "description": "Comprehensive data science program..."
  }

## üöÄ How to Use This Template
