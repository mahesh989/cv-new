[2025-09-03T23:26:55.423216] [ANALYZE_MATCH] OUTPUT:
**EXPERIENCED RECRUITER ASSESSMENT:**

**DECISION:** ðŸŸ¢ **STRONG PURSUE** (85% hiring probability)

**MARKET REALITY CHECK:**
- **What they actually need:** A competent data analyst who can handle their BI tools, manage reporting for funders, ensure data governance, and communicate insights. The core needs are: 1) BI tool proficiency, 2) Advanced Excel, 3) Reporting against KPIs, and 4) Systems administration capability.
- **Flexibility indicators:** This is a non-profit with a fixed-term contract (until June 2024 - note: JD is from 2022, likely reposted). They're more focused on practical ability to deliver than perfect credential matches. The mention of "applications will be reviewed as received" suggests urgency.
- **Hard blockers identified:** None. The "Tertiary qualification in IT, Management Information Systems or Data Analytics" is a soft requirement - a PhD in Physics and Master's in Data Science more than satisfies the intent of this requirement.
- **Hiring urgency signals:** Fixed-term contract role in non-profit suggests immediate need. The fact they're reviewing applications as they come indicates they want to fill this quickly.

**INTELLIGENT OBSERVATIONS:**
- **Hidden strengths:** Maheshwor's research background means he understands rigorous data methodology and can handle complex analysis - far beyond what this role likely requires. His teaching experience indicates strong communication skills for stakeholder reporting.
- **Smart connections:** His Python automation experience (improving pipeline efficiency by 30%) directly translates to the systems administration and data quality aspects of this role. Python skills are often a "hidden premium" that makes Excel and BI tool work more efficient.
- **Growth potential:** The trajectory from physics research to data science shows exceptional learning ability and adaptability - exactly what a fixed-term role needs.
- **Positioning opportunities:** Frame the academic research experience as "managing complex data projects with rigorous methodology" rather than "research assistant."

**REALISTIC ODDS:** 85% chance of interview if CV is properly tailored to emphasize BI/reporting experience over ML/AI.

**IF PURSUING - STRATEGIC PRIORITIES:**
1. **REFRAME TECHNICAL EXPERTISE:** Downplay the machine learning/AI emphasis and highlight BI tools, dashboard creation, and reporting experience specifically. The CV currently screams "data scientist" but this role needs "data reporter."
2. **HIGHLIGHT RELEVANT EXPERIENCE:** Emphasize the Tableau/Power BI dashboard work and the "reporting for decision-making" aspects from all roles, particularly the 99% data accuracy achievements.
3. **ADDRESS PERCEIVED GAP:** While he has Systems Administration experience through his tech stack (GitHub, Docker), he should explicitly connect this to "managing BI platforms and ensuring data integrity" in his cover letter.

**HONEST BOTTOM LINE:** This candidate is significantly overqualified technically but needs to position himself as wanting to apply his skills in the social impact space. The fixed-term nature works in his favor - they'll be thrilled to get someone of his caliber for a contract role. The main risk is appearing overqualified and likely to leave, which can be addressed by expressing genuine interest in their mission. Worth tailoring and applying immediately - this is a strong match despite the JD being from a different industry.
