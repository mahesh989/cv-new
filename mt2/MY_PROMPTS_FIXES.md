# My Prompts Page - Overflow Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Action Bar Overflow
**Problem**: On mobile devices, the action bar with "Customize AI prompts..." text and buttons was overflowing horizontally.

**Solution**: 
- Added `LayoutBuilder` to detect screen width
- Mobile layout (< 600px): Vertical stacking with buttons in a row
- Desktop layout: Horizontal layout with proper text overflow handling
- Added `maxLines` and `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis` to text

### 2. Category Header Overflow  
**Problem**: Category headers with icon, title, description, and badge were overflowing on narrow screens.

**Solution**:
- Mobile layout (< 500px): Vertical stacking with icon and title on first row, description below
- Desktop layout: Horizontal layout with proper text wrapping
- Reduced icon and font sizes for mobile
- Badge shows only number count on mobile

### 3. Prompt Card Header Overflow
**Problem**: Prompt card headers with icon, title, description, and "Modified" badge were overflowing.

**Solution**:
- Mobile layout (< 400px): Icon and title on first row, description below
- Desktop layout: Horizontal layout with text overflow handling  
- Smaller "Modified" badge on mobile
- Added `maxLines: 2` to descriptions

### 4. Tab Bar Text Overflow
**Problem**: Long category names in tab bar were causing overflow.

**Solution**:
- Added container with `maxWidth: 120` constraint
- Applied `TextOverflow.ellipsis` to tab text
- Reduced font size to 14px
- Set `tabAlignment: TabAlignment.start`
