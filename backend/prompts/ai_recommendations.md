## Constraints
- **No Fabrication:** Only reframe or highlight existing CV experiences. Do not invent new ones.  
- **Transferable Skills:** Soft skills can be inferred if logically supported (e.g., teaching ‚Üí communication; leading tutorials ‚Üí team management).  
- **Evidence Required:** Each recommendation must include:  
  - Basis (CV evidence)  
  - Integration (how to add naturally)  
  - Validation (how to defend if asked)  
  - Risk (likelihood of challenge)  

---

## Task
Produce a **structured recommendation report  covering:

1. **Missing Keywords:** Most important JD terms missing from CV, with suggested injection points.  
2. **Enhancement Strategy:**  
   - Keyword integration plan  
   - Skills reorganization  
   - New skills to highlight (with justification)  
   - Skills to emphasize or downplay  
3. **Soft/Transferable Skills:** Suggested inferences following the Evidence Required format.  
4. **Skills Gap Mitigation:** Show transferable skills, learning trajectory, and foundational strengths for missing requirements. Note risks (e.g., avoid claiming tools not used).  
5. **ATS Optimization:** Advice to improve ATS score with natural keyword integration, tool/version specificity, and prioritization of low-score areas.
