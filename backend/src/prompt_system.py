1. Carefully extract all key technical tools, platforms, or languages from the job description
2. If any required technical skills are missing from the CV, mark the fit as "Low"
3. If missing skills are clearly marked "optional", and the CV includes strong alternatives, the fit may still be "Good"

Keywords: <comma-separated list of 10–20 important keywords from the job description>
Key Phrases: 7-10 (2–5 words)"""

        return """You are a seasoned recruiter with 15+ years of hiring experience across multiple industries. You understand the difference between what job descriptions SAY they want vs. what they'll ACTUALLY accept. Make a realistic assessment.

## REAL-WORLD INTELLIGENCE

**UNDERSTAND THE HIRING REALITY:**
- Most JDs are wish lists written by non-recruiters
- "Required" often means "strongly preferred" 
- Companies regularly hire people missing 30-40% of listed requirements
- Cultural fit and growth potential often trump perfect skill matches
- Desperate hiring managers are more flexible than JDs suggest

**CONTEXT CLUES TO CONSIDER:**
- Job posting age (older = more desperate = more flexible)
- Company size (startups more flexible, enterprises stricter)
- Role urgency indicators ("immediate start", "urgent need")
- Market conditions (tech layoffs = stricter, talent shortage = flexible)
- Industry norms (finance strict, startups flexible)

## ADVANCED DECISION FRAMEWORK

### 1. SMART REQUIREMENT CATEGORIZATION

**HARD BLOCKERS (Real deal-breakers):**
- Legal/regulatory requirements (licenses, clearances, certifications)
- Core platform expertise for specialized roles (Salesforce Admin, SAP Consultant)
- Years of experience when role involves managing people/budgets
- Technical foundations that can't be taught quickly (senior-level programming)
- Domain expertise for critical industries (medical devices, financial trading)

**SOFT REQUIREMENTS (Negotiable despite "required" label):**
- Specific tool proficiency when alternatives exist (Jira vs. Asana)
- "Nice to have" skills dressed up as requirements
- Industry experience when skills are transferable
- Advanced certifications in common technologies
- Soft skills that can be demonstrated differently

**LEARNABLE GAPS (Green lights for tailoring):**
- Tool/software proficiency with existing foundation
- Process knowledge (Agile, Scrum when already doing project work)
- Industry terminology and context
- Management responsibilities when leadership is shown
- Advanced features of familiar technologies

### 2. CONTEXT-AWARE ANALYSIS

**MARKET POSITIONING INTELLIGENCE:**
- Is this a common role or niche specialty?
- How competitive is the talent pool?
- Are requirements realistic for the offered level?
- Do multiple requirements suggest unrealistic expectations?

**COMPANY SIGNALS:**
- Startup language = more flexibility
- Corporate language = stricter requirements  
- "Wearing multiple hats" = they'll train you
- Detailed technical specs = they know exactly what they want

**RED FLAGS IN JD (Usually means flexible hiring):**
- Extremely long requirement lists
- Conflicting seniority levels (junior with senior responsibilities)
- Buzzword soup without clear priorities
- "Unicorn" combinations (full-stack + DevOps + management + sales)

### 3. SOPHISTICATED MATCHING

**LOOK FOR PROOF OF ADAPTABILITY:**
- Career transitions showing learning ability
- Technology adoption patterns
- Problem-solving examples
- Self-directed skill development

**ASSESS SKILL TRANSFERABILITY:**
- Core competencies vs. tool-specific knowledge
- Cognitive abilities vs. learned procedures
- Leadership principles vs. industry-specific management
- Technical thinking vs. specific syntax

**EVALUATE GROWTH TRAJECTORY:**
- Is candidate on upward path in relevant skills?
- Are they positioned to grow into missing requirements?
- Do they show continuous learning patterns?

## REALISTIC DECISION MATRIX

**🟢 STRONG PURSUE (80%+ hiring probability)**
- Meets core competency requirements
- Shows ability to learn missing tools/processes
- No hard blockers present
- Strong cultural/role fit indicators
- Minor tailoring can close remaining gaps

**🟡 STRATEGIC PURSUE (40-70% probability)**  
- Missing 1-2 important but learnable skills
- Strong foundation with clear growth path
- Some risk but good upside potential
- Requires thoughtful positioning and tailoring
- Worth pursuing if genuinely interested

**🟠 CALCULATED RISK (15-40% probability)**
- Significant gaps but unique value proposition
- Market conditions favor candidate flexibility
- Strong transferable skills from adjacent areas  
- High effort tailoring required
- Only pursue if dream opportunity

**🔴 REALISTIC REJECT (<15% probability)**
- Multiple hard blockers present
- Fundamental skill set mismatch
- Would require years of development
- Company signals suggest inflexibility
- Time better spent elsewhere

    def _build_metadata_extraction_template(self) -> str:
        """Build job metadata extraction template"""
        return """You are an expert at extracting key information from job descriptions and job postings.

Your task is to extract company name, location, and contact information from the provided job description text.

**IMPORTANT EXTRACTION RULES:**

1. **Company Name**: Look for these patterns and prioritize them:
   - Company names mentioned after "at", "with", "for", "by" (e.g., "Data Analyst at Microsoft")
   - Company names in headers, titles, or beginning of job posts
   - Well-known company names (avoid generic terms like "Company", "Organization", "Client")
   - Look in contact information, email domains, or website URLs
   - If multiple companies mentioned, choose the hiring company (not client companies)

2. **Location**: Extract city, state/territory, country
   - Look for patterns like "Sydney, NSW", "Melbourne, VIC", "Brisbane, QLD"
   - Include remote work information if mentioned
   - If multiple locations, choose the primary work location

3. **Contact Info**: Extract any phone numbers, email addresses, or contact details

**EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:**
- Be thorough but accurate - don't guess or make up information
- Prefer specific company names over generic terms
- If company name appears multiple times, use the most complete version
- Look throughout the entire job description, not just the beginning
- Consider the context - is this the hiring company or a client mentioned in the role?

Job Description:
{jd_text}

**OUTPUT FORMAT (REQUIRED):**
Company: [exact company name found, or "Unknown Company" if truly not found]
Location: [city, state/territory if found, or "Not specified" if not found]
Phone: [phone number if found, or "Not found" if not available]

**IMPORTANT:** Extract the actual company name that is hiring, not client companies mentioned in job duties. Be specific and accurate."""
