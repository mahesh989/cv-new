# Enhanced prompt template with technical skills, soft skills, and domain keywords

Extract SOFT SKILLS, TECHNICAL SKILLS, and DOMAIN KEYWORDS from this {analysis_context} and categorize them:

IMPORTANT: Only extract skills/keywords that are explicitly mentioned or have very strong textual evidence. Avoid assumptions or industry-standard inferences. Do not repeat skills/keywords that are already mentioned. 

## {text_type.upper()}: 
{input_text}

## SOFT SKILLS:
EXPLICIT (directly stated): List soft skills clearly mentioned
STRONGLY IMPLIED (very likely based on responsibilities): List soft skills heavily suggested with strong textual evidence

## TECHNICAL SKILLS:
EXPLICIT (directly stated): List technical skills, tools, software, qualifications clearly mentioned
STRONGLY IMPLIED (very likely based on responsibilities): List technical skills heavily suggested with strong textual evidence

## DOMAIN KEYWORDS:
EXPLICIT: List industry terms, sector-specific language, compliance areas, methodologies, and domain-specific concepts that are directly mentioned
STRONGLY IMPLIED: List domain keywords that are heavily suggested by the job context and responsibilities


## DOMAIN KEYWORDS:

EXPLICIT:  Your task is to extract **domain-specific keywords** related strictly to the **job role or functional expertise**, NOT the industry, organization, or its values.  
  List **industry terms**, **role-specific language**, **tools**, **methodologies**, **compliance concepts**, and **domain knowledge** that are **directly mentioned** in the {analysis_context}.

STRONGLY IMPLIED:  
  Your task is to extract **domain-specific keywords** related strictly to the **job role or functional expertise**, NOT the industry, organization, or its values.  
  List **domain-relevant concepts** that are **heavily suggested** by the context, responsibilities, or required outputs ‚Äî even if not explicitly named.

### DO NOT include:
- Company or organization names  
- Program/service titles  
- Sector-level social causes  
- Values or mission statements  



## CONTEXT EVIDENCE:
For each skill/keyword, provide the relevant quote from the {analysis_context} that supports the extraction

At the end, provide THREE FINAL CLEAN LISTS:
1. SOFT SKILLS - Python list of strings containing all soft skills
2. TECHNICAL SKILLS - Python list of strings containing all technical skills  
3. DOMAIN KEYWORDS - Python list of strings containing all domain-specific terms
