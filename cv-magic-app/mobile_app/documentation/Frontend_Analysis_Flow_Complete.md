## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`/lib/widgets/skills_display_widget.dart`**
   - ✅ Added Component Analysis section (lines ~380-449)
   - ✅ Added AI Recommendations section (lines ~467-563)
   - ✅ Added helper methods for score display (lines ~732-784)

2. **`/lib/models/skills_analysis_model.dart`**
   - ✅ Updated ATSResult model to include `recommendations` field
   - ✅ Added proper JSON parsing for recommendations array

### Progressive Display Logic

The frontend uses a sophisticated progressive display system:

```dart
// Step 1: Skills extraction (immediate)
_result = SkillsAnalysisResult(cvSkills, jdSkills, ...);

// Step 2: Analyze Match (10-second delay)
Timer(Duration(seconds: 10), () {
  _result = _result.copyWith(analyzeMatch: _fullResult.analyzeMatch);
});

// Step 3: AI-Powered Skills Analysis (10-second delay)
Timer(Duration(seconds: 10), () {
  _result = _result.copyWith(preextractedRawOutput: ...);
});

// Step 4: Background polling for Component Analysis & ATS
_startPollingForCompleteResults();
```

### State Management

Each section has specific conditions for display:

- **Skills Analysis**: `controller.result != null`
- **Analyze Match**: `controller.hasAnalyzeMatch`
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: `controller.result?.hasPreextractedComparison == true`
- **Component Analysis**: `controller.hasComponentAnalysis` 
- **ATS Score**: `controller.hasATSResult`
- **AI Recommendations**: `controller.hasATSResult && recommendations.isNotEmpty`

## User Experience
