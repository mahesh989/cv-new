# Structured CV Parser - Improvements Report

## Problem Analysis

The original structured CV parser was extracting less than **15%** of available CV content, leading to:

- Mixed personal information fields (phone/email/location combined)
- Empty career profile despite rich content in source
- Missing education, experience, projects, and certifications sections
- Only partial technical skills extraction
- Poor section recognition for real CV formats

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Personal Information Parsing ✅
**Before:**
```json
{
  "name": "Maheshwor Tiwari",
  "phone": "",
  "email": "0414 032 507 | maheshtwari99@gmail.com | LinkedIn | Hurstville, NSW, 2220",
  "location": "",
  "linkedin": ""
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "name": "Maheshwor Tiwari",
  "phone": "0414 032 507",
  "email": "maheshtwari99@gmail.com",

  "portfolio_links": {

    "dashboard_portfolio": "Dashboard Portfolio Available"
  }
}
```

- Email extraction: `([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})`
- Date range extraction: `(\w{3}\s\d{4}\s*[-–]\s*\w{3}\s\d{4})`
- GPA extraction: `GPA\s*[-:]?\s*([\d.]+\s*/\s*[\d.]+|[\d.]+%)`

## Files Modified

1. **`app/services/structured_cv_parser.py`** - Enhanced with comprehensive parsing methods

3. Implement better location extraction from contact lines
4. Consider adding AI-powered parsing for complex formats
5. Add validation for extracted data quality
