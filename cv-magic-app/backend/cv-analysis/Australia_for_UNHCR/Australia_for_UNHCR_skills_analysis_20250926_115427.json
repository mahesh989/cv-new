Maheshwor meets or exceeds all technical requirements.\n\n**Hiring urgency signals:**\n- 15-month contract suggests project-based urgency\n- Specific application close date indicates real vacancy\n- NFP often has tighter timelines due to funding cycles\n\n---\n\n### **INTELLIGENT OBSERVATIONS:**\n\n**Hidden strengths:**\n- PhD-level research experience translates to exceptional problem-solving for \"building projection and segmentation models\"\n- Academic background suggests ability to handle complex data issues that stump typical analysts\n- Multiple short-term roles show adaptability - valuable for contract position\n\n**Smart connections:**\n- Python automation experience directly applicable to \"manipulating data for bulk communications\"\n- Research assistant work involved \"managing complex datasets\" - directly transferable to data warehouse environment\n- Teaching experience demonstrates stakeholder communication skills missing from JD but critically important\n\n**Growth potential:**\n- Clear trajectory from physics research → data science → practical analytics\n- Demonstrated ability to learn new tools quickly (Snowflake, Docker mention shows modern tech awareness)\n\n**Positioning opportunities:**\n- Frame academic research as \"solving complex business problems with data\"\n- Position short contract roles as \"delivering rapid value in dynamic environments\"\n\n---\n\n### **REALISTIC ODDS:** \n**85% chance of interview with proper tailoring**  \n*(Would be 95%+ if he had direct non-profit experience)*\n\n---\n\n### **IF PURSUING - STRATEGIC PRIORITIES:**\n\n1. **Priority 1:** Re-frame entire CV around **marketing analytics and donor-centric language** - highlight \"customer behavior insights\" from Google Analytics experience\n2. **Priority 2:** Emphasize **stakeholder management** from teaching and cross-functional team experience\n3. **Priority 3:** Address **contract length perception** by positioning as \"seeking meaningful mission-driven work\"\n\n---\n\n### **HONEST BOTTOM LINE:**\n\n**This is an above-average fit that most hiring managers would interview immediately.** The PhD might initially seem overqualified, but for a specialized 15-month contract requiring sophisticated modeling, it's actually an advantage. The main risk is appearing \"too academic\" - which is easily mitigated by emphasizing the practical business outcomes in his recent roles.\n\n**Worth the effort? Absolutely.** This is exactly the type of candidate who often outperforms expectations because the analytical foundation is rock-solid. The missing non-profit experience is easily learned by someone with this learning capacity.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:** Tailor aggressively toward the fundraising/marketing analytics angle and submit within 48 hours while the posting is fresh."
