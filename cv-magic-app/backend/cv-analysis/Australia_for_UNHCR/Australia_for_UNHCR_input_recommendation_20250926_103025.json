The NFP sector particularly values intellectual horsepower and mission alignment over perfect industry experience. Maheshwor's technical skills are overqualified for this role - the challenge is convincing them his physics background is an asset, not a mismatch.\n\n**Key insight:** UNHCR isn't hiring a fundraiser - they're hiring someone who can handle complex refugee data. A PhD physicist who can actually communicate with stakeholders is probably overqualified but may be exactly what they need for sophisticated data challenges.\n\n**Recommendation:** Apply with confidence, but spend extra time on the cover letter connecting his background to humanitarian data work. The technical fit is solid - it's about telling the right story."
