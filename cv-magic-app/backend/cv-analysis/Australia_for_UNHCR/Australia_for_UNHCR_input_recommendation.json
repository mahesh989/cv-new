      "content": "**DECISION:** \ud83d\udfe1 STRATEGIC PURSUE\n\n**MARKET REALITY CHECK:**\n- **What they actually need:** The core requirements for this role include strong SQL skills, experience with Power BI (or similar BI tools), and the ability to work with data for marketing campaigns. The job description emphasizes stakeholder management and communication skills, which are critical for the role. While they list a minimum of 2 years of experience, many organizations are willing to consider candidates with less experience if they demonstrate strong potential and relevant skills.\n  \n- **Flexibility indicators:** The organization is a non-profit, which often means they are more flexible with their hiring criteria, especially if they find a candidate who aligns well with their mission and values. The language used in the JD suggests they are looking for a \"highly motivated\" individual, indicating they may prioritize cultural fit and potential over strict experience requirements.\n\n- **Hard blockers identified:** There are no explicit hard blockers in Maheshwor's CV. However, he lacks direct experience in fundraising data analysis and may not have the 2 years of experience specified in the JD.\n\n- **Hiring urgency signals:** The job was posted in March 2025, and while it is a contract position, there are no immediate urgency indicators suggesting they are desperate to fill the role quickly.\n\n**INTELLIGENT OBSERVATIONS:**\n- **Hidden strengths:** Maheshwor has strong analytical skills, demonstrated through his experience with Python, SQL, and Power BI. His project management experience and ability to deliver insights from data are valuable assets. His thesis and projects show a solid foundation in data analysis and problem-solving, which can be framed as relevant experience for the role.\n\n- **Smart connections:** His experience in data analysis and reporting aligns well with the job's requirements for data mining and report authoring. His work with cross-functional teams at iBuild and Property Console shows he can collaborate effectively, which is crucial for stakeholder management.\n\n- **Growth potential:** Maheshwor's eagerness to learn and adapt is evident in his CV. His ongoing education in Data Science and certifications in SQL and Google Analytics indicate a commitment to continuous improvement, which is appealing to employers.\n\n- **Positioning opportunities:** Highlighting his experience with data-driven decision-making and his ability to manage projects under tight deadlines will be key. He should also emphasize his adaptability and eagerness to learn about fundraising and donor-centric data analysis.\n\n**REALISTIC ODDS:** 60% chance of getting an interview if the CV is tailored well to highlight relevant skills and experiences.\n\n**IF PURSUING - STRATEGIC PRIORITIES:**\n1. **Priority 1:** Emphasize experience with data analysis and reporting, particularly in the context of decision-making and stakeholder communication.\n2. **Priority 2:** Highlight any relevant coursework or projects related to fundraising or donor management to bridge the gap in direct experience.\n3. **Priority 3:** Address the lack of 2 years of experience by framing his internships and project work as equivalent experience, focusing on the skills and outcomes achieved.\n\n**HONEST BOTTOM LINE:** Maheshwor has a solid foundation and relevant skills that align well with the job requirements. While he may not meet the experience criteria perfectly, his analytical capabilities, eagerness to learn, and potential for growth make him a strong candidate worth pursuing. Tailoring his CV to highlight these aspects will enhance his chances of securing an interview."
