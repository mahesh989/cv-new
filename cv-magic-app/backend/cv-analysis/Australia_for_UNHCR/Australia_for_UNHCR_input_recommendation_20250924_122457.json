The role also emphasizes strong stakeholder management and communication skills.\n- **Flexibility indicators:** The organization is a non-profit that values mission-driven work, suggesting they may prioritize cultural fit and passion for the cause over a perfect match on technical skills. The job posting indicates a collaborative environment, which often allows for some flexibility in skills and experience.\n- **Hard blockers identified:** There are no clear hard blockers in Maheshwor's CV. He has relevant experience in data analysis, SQL, and BI tools, but he may lack direct experience in marketing campaign data extraction, which is a key requirement.\n- **Hiring urgency signals:** The job was posted in March 2025, and while we don't know the exact urgency, the contract nature of the position suggests they may be looking to fill it promptly.\n\n**INTELLIGENT OBSERVATIONS:**\n- **Hidden strengths:** Maheshwor's PhD in Physics and Master's in Data Science demonstrate strong analytical skills and a solid foundation in data handling. His experience in building dashboards and using Python for data analysis aligns well with the role's requirements.\n- **Smart connections:** His experience with Python and SQL, along with his ability to create dashboards, positions him well for the analytical aspects of the role. His background in academia may also indicate strong problem-solving skills and the ability to communicate complex ideas clearly.\n- **Growth potential:** Maheshwor has shown a trajectory of continuous learning and skill development, which is valuable. His recent roles indicate he is actively applying his skills in practical settings.\n- **Positioning opportunities:** Emphasizing his experience with data-driven decision-making and his ability to work collaboratively with stakeholders will be crucial. Highlighting any experience related to marketing or fundraising analytics, even if indirect, will strengthen his application.\n\n**REALISTIC ODDS:** 60% chance of getting an interview if the CV is tailored well to emphasize relevant skills and experiences, particularly in data extraction and stakeholder collaboration.\n\n**IF PURSUING - STRATEGIC PRIORITIES:**\n1. **Priority 1:** Highlight experience with data extraction and analysis for decision-making, particularly in contexts similar to fundraising or marketing.\n2. **Priority 2:** Emphasize proficiency in SQL and any specific projects that demonstrate his ability to work with complex databases and BI tools like Power BI.\n3. **Priority 3:** Address the gap in direct marketing campaign experience by framing his analytical work in previous roles as relevant to understanding donor behavior and campaign effectiveness.\n\n**HONEST BOTTOM LINE:** Maheshwor has a solid foundation and relevant experience that aligns well with the role, but he will need to strategically position his skills to address the specific requirements of the job. With tailored adjustments to his CV and a focus on transferable skills, he stands a good chance of securing an interview. It's worth the effort to pursue this opportunity, especially given the potential for personal and professional growth in a mission-driven organization."
