      "content": "**DECISION:** 🟡 STRATEGIC PURSUE\n\n---\n\n### MARKET REALITY CHECK:\n\n- **What they actually need:** \n  - The core requirements for this role are strong SQL skills, experience with Power BI, and the ability to design data models. While the JD lists 5+ years of experience, hiring managers often prioritize candidates who can demonstrate strong capabilities over strict adherence to years of experience, especially if they can show relevant projects or internships.\n\n- **Flexibility indicators:** \n  - The job description has a detailed list of requirements, which typically indicates a clear vision of what they want. However, the presence of \"nice-to-haves\" and the language around collaboration suggests they may be open to candidates who can demonstrate potential and adaptability rather than strict experience.\n\n- **Hard blockers identified:** \n  - The requirement for 5+ years of experience in data engineering is a significant blocker for Maheshwor, who has only 2 years of experience. However, there are no legal or regulatory requirements that would disqualify him outright.\n\n- **Hiring urgency signals:** \n  - The job description does not explicitly state urgency, but the detailed nature of the role and the focus on collaborative work may indicate that they are looking to fill this position relatively soon.\n\n---\n\n### INTELLIGENT OBSERVATIONS:\n\n- **Hidden strengths:** \n  - Maheshwor has strong SQL skills and experience with Power BI, both of which are critical for this role. His academic projects, particularly the optimization of machine learning models, demonstrate technical proficiency and problem-solving skills that could be appealing.\n\n- **Smart connections:** \n  - His experience in data analysis and dashboard creation aligns well with the responsibilities of building and maintaining Power BI dashboards. His ability to analyze large datasets and ensure data integrity is also relevant.\n\n- **Growth potential:** \n  - Maheshwor is currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Science, which shows a commitment to continuous learning and improvement. His projects indicate a strong grasp of advanced concepts, which could be leveraged to demonstrate his potential to grow into the role.\n\n- **Positioning opportunities:** \n  - Highlighting his hands-on experience with SQL and Power BI, along with his academic projects, can help position him as a candidate who, while less experienced, has the foundational skills and a strong learning trajectory.\n\n---\n\n### REALISTIC ODDS: \n- **Chance of getting an interview if CV tailored well:** 50-60%\n\n---\n\n### IF PURSUING - STRATEGIC PRIORITIES:\n\n1. **Priority 1:** Emphasize hands-on experience with SQL and Power BI, detailing specific projects and outcomes to demonstrate capability.\n   \n2. **Priority 2:** Highlight the academic projects, particularly the machine learning thesis, to showcase technical skills and problem-solving abilities relevant to data modeling and analysis.\n\n3. **Priority 3:** Address the experience gap by framing his 2 years of experience as intensive and relevant, focusing on the quality of work and outcomes rather than the quantity of years.\n\n---\n\n### HONEST BOTTOM LINE:\nWhile Maheshwor lacks the required years of experience, he possesses relevant skills and a strong educational background that could make him a valuable candidate. The hiring manager may be willing to consider a candidate who shows potential and adaptability, especially if they are struggling to find someone with the exact experience required. Tailoring the CV to highlight relevant skills and projects will be crucial in making a strong case for his candidacy. It’s worth the effort to pursue this opportunity, given the potential for flexibility in the hiring process."
