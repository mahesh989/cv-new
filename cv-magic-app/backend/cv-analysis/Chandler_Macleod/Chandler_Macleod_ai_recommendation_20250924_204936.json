Emphasize how these skills can apply to the new domain by providing context and examples of impact in previous roles.\n\n**Seniority Positioning (65.0/100 current match):**\n- Highlight any leadership roles or responsibilities taken in projects. If there are instances of mentoring junior colleagues or leading project teams, these should be specified to elevate perceived seniority.\n\n**Technical Depth Showcase (90.0/100 current score):**\n- Showcase technical achievements by detailing complex projects where advanced tools like 'Power BI' and 'Python' were utilized. Mention specific outcomes or efficiencies gained from these efforts to illustrate technical depth.\n\n## ‚ö†Ô∏è Strategic Warnings\n- **Don't Oversell:** Avoid claiming expertise in tools or systems not explicitly used (e.g., Fieldglass, SAP Ariba) to prevent potential discrepancies during interviews.\n- **Don't Undersell:** Highlight the breadth of technical skills already possessed. For instance, the competence in Python and data analysis should be framed as strengths that can easily transition to meet the role's demands.\n\n## üìå Section Completeness Notes\n- While the current CV structure seems adequate, consider enhancing the **Projects** section if applicable. Highlighting specific projects related to data analysis or visualization would add depth and demonstrate practical application of skills.\n- In the **Certifications** section, if certifications like SQL or Power BI are missing, consider adding those if they exist. If not, acquiring relevant certifications can be beneficial in future applications.\n\n---\n\n**Strategic Note:** This analysis is based on comprehensive data including actual ATS calculations, component analysis, and strategic assessment. Focus on evidence-based improvements that maximize authenticity while optimizing for ATS performance and interview success.",
