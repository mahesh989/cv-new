## Technical Solutions Applied

### Location Pattern Optimization
**Problem:** "Victoria, Australia" was being incorrectly matched by general VIC pattern
**Solution:** Reordered location patterns by specificity:

```python
location_patterns = [
    # Specific City, Country patterns (most specific first)
    r'(Sydney, Australia)',
    r'(Victoria, Australia)',  # Must come before general VIC pattern
    
    # State abbreviations with Australia  
    r'((?:NSW|QLD|WA|SA|TAS|NT|ACT), Australia)',  # VIC removed
    
    # General patterns (least specific, last)
    r'([A-Za-z\s]+, (?:NSW|QLD|WA|SA|TAS|NT|ACT))'  # VIC removed
]
```

### Text Cleaning Enhancement
**Problem:** Location text wasn't properly removed from institution/company names
**Solution:** Multiple cleaning approaches:

```python
if location:
    clean_name = original_name
    clean_name = clean_name.replace(f", {location}", "")
    clean_name = clean_name.replace(location, "")
    final_name = clean_name.strip().rstrip(',').strip()
```
