# CV Tailoring Skills Format Fix

## Problem Identified

The CV tailoring service was failing with Pydantic validation errors when trying to load tailored CV files. The error was:

```
‚ùå Failed to load real data for Australia_for_UNHCR: 7 validation errors for OriginalCV
skills.0
  Input should be a valid dictionary or instance of SkillCategory [type=model_type, input_value='SQL', input_type=str]
```

## Root Cause

The issue was a **data format mismatch** between the tailored CV JSON structure and the expected `OriginalCV` model:

### **Tailored CV JSON Format** (Actual):
```json
{
  "skills": ["SQL", "Excel", "Python", "Power BI", "VBA", "Data Analysis", "Data Warehouse"]
}
```

### **OriginalCV Model Expected Format**:
```json
{
  "skills": [
    {"skills": ["SQL", "Excel", "Python", "Power BI", "VBA", "Data Analysis", "Data Warehouse"]}
  ]
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### **File**: `cv-magic-app/backend/app/tailored_cv/services/cv_tailoring_service.py`

### **Change**: Added skills data transformation in `load_real_cv_and_recommendation()` method

```python
# Transform skills data format if needed
if 'skills' in cv_data and isinstance(cv_data['skills'], list):
    # Check if skills are simple strings (need transformation)
    if cv_data['skills'] and isinstance(cv_data['skills'][0], str):
        logger.info("üîÑ [TAILORING] Transforming skills from string array to SkillCategory format")
        # Transform from ["SQL", "Excel", ...] to [{"skills": ["SQL", "Excel", ...]}]
        cv_data['skills'] = [{"skills": cv_data['skills']}]
        logger.info(f"- Transformed skills: {cv_data['skills']}")
```

## How the Fix Works

1. **Detection**: Checks if skills data exists and is a list
2. **Format Check**: Verifies if skills are simple strings (not already SkillCategory objects)
3. **Transformation**: Converts from `["skill1", "skill2", ...]` to `[{"skills": ["skill1", "skill2", ...]}]`
4. **Logging**: Provides clear logging for debugging

## Expected Result

- **Before**: CV tailoring service fails with Pydantic validation errors
- **After**: CV tailoring service successfully loads tailored CV files and creates `OriginalCV` objects
- **Logs**: Should show transformation messages like:
  ```
  üîÑ [TAILORING] Transforming skills from string array to SkillCategory format
  - Transformed skills: [{'skills': ['SQL', 'Excel', 'Python', ...]}]
  ```

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Run Analysis**: Perform a rerun analysis for a company
2. **Check Logs**: Look for the transformation messages in the logs
3. **Verify Success**: CV tailoring should complete without validation errors
4. **Check Output**: Tailored CV should be generated successfully

## Files Modified

- `cv-magic-app/backend/app/tailored_cv/services/cv_tailoring_service.py`

## Additional Notes

This fix handles the specific case where tailored CV files have skills as a simple array of strings, which is common when the CV is generated by the system. The transformation ensures compatibility with the `OriginalCV` model structure while preserving all the skill data.

The fix is backward compatible and won't affect CVs that already have the correct SkillCategory format.
