# Skill Extraction Prompt Improvements

## Overview
Updated the skill extraction prompts to be more generic, comprehensive, and effective for analyzing any CV or Job Description across thousands of users and domains.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Removed Qualifiers**
- Extracts pure skills without qualifiers like "Advanced", "Expert", "5+ years", etc.
- Example: "Advanced SQL" → extracts "SQL" only

### 2. **Proper Categorization Priority**
- Technical Skills > Soft Skills > Domain Keywords
- Each skill appears in only ONE category
- More specific category wins

### 3. **No Duplicates**
- Prevents exact duplicates (e.g., "Python" appearing twice)
- Prevents semantic duplicates (e.g., "Data Analysis" and "Data Analytics")
- Keeps the most specific version

### 4. **Generic Approach**
- Removed specific tool examples that might bias extraction
- Made categories broader to handle any industry/domain
- Focus on skill types rather than specific skills

### 5. **Clear Category Definitions**

#### Technical Skills
- Programming/scripting languages
- Software/applications (domain-specific)
- Databases and data storage
- Cloud/infrastructure platforms
- Frameworks and libraries
- APIs, protocols, standards
- Development and analytics tools
- Technical methodologies (CI/CD, DevOps)

#### Soft Skills
- Interpersonal skills (Communication, Leadership)
- Personal effectiveness (Time Management, Organization)
- Professional traits (Analytical Thinking, Creativity)
- Work style (Detail-oriented, Self-motivated)

#### Domain Keywords
- Industry/sector terminology
- Business functions (Risk Management, Supply Chain)
- Domain-specific processes
- Professional methodologies (Agile, Six Sigma)
- Industry standards/regulations
- Business concepts (ROI Analysis, Market Research)

### 6. **Extraction Rules**
- Extract from all sections including "nice-to-have" requirements
- Keep exact capitalization for proper nouns
- Include version numbers if meaningful
- Focus on job-relevant skills only
- Avoid generic business terms, company names, locations

### 7. **Output Format**
- Three deduplicated Python lists
- No skill appears in multiple lists
- Clean, pure skills without qualifiers
- Properly capitalized

## Benefits
1. **Scalability**: Works for any industry, role, or domain
2. **Accuracy**: Clear rules prevent irrelevant extractions
3. **Consistency**: Standardized categorization across all documents
4. **Completeness**: Captures skills from all document sections
5. **Usability**: Clean output ready for matching algorithms

## Example Transformations

### Before:
- "5+ years experience with Advanced Python" → "Advanced Python", "5+ years experience"
- "Expert in SQL and PostgreSQL databases" → "Expert SQL", "PostgreSQL databases"

### After:
- "5+ years experience with Advanced Python" → "Python"
- "Expert in SQL and PostgreSQL databases" → "SQL", "PostgreSQL"

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with diverse job descriptions from different industries
2. Verify no duplicates across categories
3. Check that qualifiers are properly removed
4. Ensure all relevant skills are captured
5. Validate categorization follows priority rules
