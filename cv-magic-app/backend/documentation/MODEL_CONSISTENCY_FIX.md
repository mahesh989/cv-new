# Model Consistency Fix Documentation

## Problem Statement

Users reported that not all LLM models were working consistently across the application. Specifically:
- When using GPT-4o for the first time, files weren't being saved
- Other models like GPT-turbo and DeepSeek-chat worked correctly
- This indicated inconsistent behavior across different LLM models

## Root Cause

The issue was that model selection through the `X-Current-Model` header wasn't being properly persisted throughout the entire request lifecycle. This caused:
1. Model switching to happen but not persist through async operations
2. File saving operations to potentially use a different model than the one processing the request
3. No tracking of which model was used for each operation

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Request-Scoped Model Tracking

Added a `ContextVar` to track the current model throughout the request lifecycle:

```python
# In app/core/model_dependency.py
from contextvars import ContextVar

request_model: ContextVar[Optional[str]] = ContextVar('request_model', default=None)
```

This ensures the model selection persists across all async operations within a request.

### 2. Model Dependency Enhancement

Updated `get_current_model` dependency to:
- Check for existing model in the request context first
- Store the selected model in the context for the entire request
- Provide a `get_request_model()` function for other components to access

### 3. AI Service Model Consistency

Enhanced the AI service to:
- Check for request-specific model before generating responses
- Log which model is actually being used for each operation
- Ensure the provider's model matches the request model

### 4. File Saving with Model Information

Updated the result saver to:
- Track which model was used in all saved files
- Include `model_used` field in JSON output
- Ensure consistency across all file operations

## Changes Made

### Files Modified

1. **`app/core/model_dependency.py`**
   - Added `ContextVar` for request-scoped model tracking
   - Enhanced model persistence throughout request lifecycle
   - Added `get_request_model()` helper function
   - Used lazy imports to avoid circular dependency with ai_service

2. **`app/ai/ai_service.py`**
   - Import and use `get_request_model`
   - Check request-specific model in `generate_response`
   - Log actual model being used

3. **`app/services/skill_extraction/result_saver.py`**
   - Import `get_request_model`
   - Add `model_used` field to all saved JSON files
   - Track model in analyze_match and preextracted_comparison entries

### New Test Scripts

1. **`test_model_consistency.py`** - Comprehensive automated test suite
2. **`test_model_simple.py`** - Simple manual verification script

## How It Works

1. When a request comes in with `X-Current-Model` header:
   - The model is validated and switched in the AI service
   - The model ID is stored in the request context
   
2. Throughout the request:
   - All AI operations use the request-specific model
   - The model persists across async operations
   
3. When saving files:
   - The current request model is retrieved
   - It's included in all saved data for tracking

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Testing

1. Run the simple test script:
```bash
python test_model_simple.py
```

2. Check that:
   - Each model processes requests successfully
   - Files are saved for all models
   - The correct model name is recorded in each file

### Automated Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python test_model_consistency.py
```

This tests:
- Preliminary analysis with each model
- Skill extraction with each model  
- File saving consistency
- Model tracking accuracy

## Verification

After implementing this fix, you should see:

1. **Consistent file saving** - All models save files properly
2. **Model tracking** - Each saved file shows which model was used
3. **Reliable behavior** - No differences between models in core functionality

## Example Output

When you examine a saved skills analysis file, you'll now see:

```json
{
  "generated": "2025-01-13T05:45:57.123",
  "cv_filename": "test_cv.pdf",
  "jd_url": "preliminary_analysis",
  "user_id": 1,
  "company": "Example_Company",
  "model_used": "gpt-4o",  // <-- This tracks which model was used
  "cv_skills": { ... },
  "jd_skills": { ... }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency** - All models work uniformly across all functionality
2. **Traceability** - You can see which model generated each result
3. **Reliability** - Model selection persists throughout async operations
4. **Debugging** - Easier to troubleshoot model-specific issues

## Future Improvements

Consider adding:
- Model performance metrics tracking
- Model-specific configuration options
- Automatic fallback to alternative models on failure
- Model usage analytics dashboard
