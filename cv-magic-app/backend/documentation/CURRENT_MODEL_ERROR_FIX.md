# Current Model Error Fix

## Problem Description

The application was encountering an error in the LLM parsing functionality:

```
Error in LLM parsing: 'AIServiceManager' object has no attribute 'current_model'
```

This error occurred in the `structured_cv_parser.py` file when trying to access `ai_service.current_model` to track which AI model was used for parsing.

## Root Cause

The `AIServiceManager` class in `app/ai/ai_service.py` did not have a `current_model` attribute or property. The structured CV parser was trying to access this attribute on lines 136 and 148 of `structured_cv_parser.py`:

```python
structured_cv["metadata"]["ai_model_used"] = ai_service.current_model
```

## Solution

### 1. Added Helper Method

Added a new method `get_current_model_name()` to the `AIServiceManager` class:

```python
def get_current_model_name(self) -> str:
    """Get the current model name"""
    current_provider = self.get_current_provider()
    if current_provider:
        return current_provider.model_name
    return self.config.get_current_model_name() or "unknown"
```

### 2. Added Current Model Property

Added a `current_model` property for backward compatibility:

```python
@property
def current_model(self) -> str:
    """Property to get the current model name for backward compatibility"""
    return self.get_current_model_name()
```

## Testing

### Test 1: Current Model Property
- ✅ `test_current_model_fix.py` verifies that the `current_model` property works correctly
- ✅ Confirms that both the property and method return the same value
- ✅ Returns the actual model name (e.g., "gpt-4o")

### Test 2: Structured CV Parser Integration
- ✅ `test_structured_cv_parser_fix.py` tests the CV parser with the fix
- ✅ Confirms that CV parsing completes successfully
- ✅ Verifies that the AI model used is properly recorded in metadata
- ✅ Validates that CV content is parsed into structured format

## Files Modified

1. **`app/ai/ai_service.py`**
   - Added `get_current_model_name()` method (lines 288-293)
   - Added `current_model` property (lines 295-298)

2. **`app/services/structured_cv_parser.py`**
   - No changes needed - now works with the new property

## Impact

- ✅ **Fixed**: LLM parsing error no longer occurs
- ✅ **Maintained**: Backward compatibility with existing code
- ✅ **Improved**: Better error handling and model tracking
- ✅ **Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage for the fix

## Usage

The `current_model` attribute can now be accessed in multiple ways:

```python
from app.ai.ai_service import ai_service

# Property access (backward compatible)
model = ai_service.current_model

# Method access (explicit)
model = ai_service.get_current_model_name()

# Both return the same value, e.g., "gpt-4o"
```

## Error Resolution

The original server error:
```
2025-09-17 10:23:46,922 - app.services.structured_cv_parser - ERROR - Error in LLM parsing: 'AIServiceManager' object has no attribute 'current_model'
```

Is now resolved and the application can successfully:
1. Parse CV content with LLM
2. Track which AI model was used
3. Store model information in metadata
4. Complete CV processing without errors

## Future Considerations

- The property provides a clean interface for accessing the current model
- The method provides more explicit access if needed
- Both approaches maintain consistency with the existing codebase
- Error handling gracefully falls back to "unknown" if no model is available
