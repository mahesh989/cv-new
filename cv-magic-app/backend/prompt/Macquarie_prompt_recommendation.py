### Strategic Assessment
**DECISION:** 🟡 STRATEGIC PURSUE

**MARKET REALITY CHECK:**

- **What they actually need:** The key requirements for this role include experience with programming languages (specifically Python), data analysis, and the ability to create visualizations and dashboards. The mention of ETL tools like Alteryx and Dataiku suggests they value experience in data engineering processes, but this is likely negotiable given the overall context of the JD.

However, the job title is "Junior Data Intelligence Analyst," which suggests they may be open to candidates who are early in their careers. The emphasis on a "problem-solving mindset" and the encouragement for diverse applicants indicates a willingness to consider candidates who may not meet every requirement.

The language used in the JD does not indicate an urgent need, but the company's commitment to diversity and inclusion may suggest they are actively seeking a broad range of candid...
