## CRITICAL INDUSTRY INTERPRETATION RULES:

### Industry Experience Priority (Corporate Reality):
- **Same industry experience = GOLD STANDARD** (90-100 score range)
- **Related industry with corporate experience** = Strong (70-85 score range)
- **Different industry but corporate background** = Moderate (50-70 score range)
- **Academic/Research to any industry** = High risk (25-50 score range MAX)
- **Completely different sectors** = Poor fit (15-35 score range)

### Industry Transition Realism Matrix:
- **Same Industry, Same Role**: 85-100 (hiring manager's dream)
- **Same Industry, Different Role**: 75-90 (internal mobility preferred)
- **Related Industry, Similar Role**: 65-80 (manageable transition)
- **Related Industry, Different Role**: 50-70 (significant investment needed)
- **Different Industry, Corporate Background**: 40-60 (major training required)
- **Academic/Research → Corporate**: 25-50 MAX (high failure risk)
- **Academic → Non-profit/NGO**: 30-55 MAX (major domain shift)
- **Technical/Academic → Commercial**: 20-45 MAX (cultural mismatch risk)

### Specific Industry Penalty Factors:
- **Regulated Industries** (Finance, Healthcare, Pharma): -20 points if no regulatory experience
- **Client-Facing Industries** (Consulting, Sales): -15 points if no client management
- **Fast-Paced Industries** (Tech, Startups): -15 points if only academic pace
- **Revenue-Driven Industries**: -20 points if no commercial experience
- **Compliance-Heavy Industries**: -25 points if no compliance background

## Scoring Guidelines (0-100 scale - Harsh Reality):
- 90-100: Same industry, proven track record (hire immediately)
- 75-89: Related industry, corporate background (strong candidate)
- 60-74: Different industry but corporate experience (invest in training)
- 40-59: Major industry shift, high investment needed (risky hire)
- 25-39: Academic/research background, significant adaptation required (high failure risk)
- 0-24: Completely different sector, poor cultural fit (avoid hiring)

## INDUSTRY TRANSITION SUCCESS PREDICTORS:
### HIGH SUCCESS PROBABILITY:
- Previous industry transitions in corporate setting
- Client-facing experience in any industry
- Revenue/budget responsibility regardless of sector
- Cross-functional project management
- Regulatory or compliance experience

### MEDIUM SUCCESS PROBABILITY:
- Some industry exposure through consulting/projects
- Transferable technical skills with business context
- Corporate environment experience (any industry)
- Stakeholder management experience
- Commercial awareness demonstration

### LOW SUCCESS PROBABILITY:
- Purely academic/research background
- No corporate environment exposure
- Industry-specific knowledge gaps
- No client/customer interaction experience
- Theoretical knowledge without practical application
