CV TEXT: {cv_text}
JD REQUIREMENTS: {jd_text}

## CRITICAL CV INTERPRETATION RULES:

### Corporate/Industrial Experience (Primary Value - 90% weight):
- Full-time corporate roles = Full professional experience value (1.0x)
- Internships at companies = 0.5x experience value
- Consulting projects = 0.6x experience value
- Freelance/contract work = 0.5x experience value
- Industry partnerships/collaborations = 0.2x experience value

### Academic Experience (Minimal Value - 10% weight):
- PhD research = 0.5-1 year equivalent maximum
- Master's thesis = 0.25 year equivalent maximum
- Academic leadership roles = Soft skills evidence only (no experience value)
- Publications = Technical competency evidence only (no experience value)
- Teaching/mentoring = Communication skills evidence only (no experience value)
- **Note: Academic experience creates overqualification risk and unrealistic expectations**

### Experience Calculation Guidelines:
- ONLY corporate/industry roles count as professional experience
- Academic experience = technical knowledge background (not professional years)
- Full-time corporate roles are the gold standard (1.0x value)
- Internships and contract work have reduced value (0.5x)
- High overqualification risk for any academic background in junior roles

### Role Level Assessment:
- Corporate progression determines role level (not academic achievements)
- Full-time corporate experience = actual seniority level
- Academic achievements without corporate experience = entry-level regardless of degree
- Overqualification concerns for PhDs in junior/mid-level roles

## Scoring Guidelines (0-100 scale):
- 90-100: Excellent corporate match, proven business experience
- 75-89: Strong corporate background, minor gaps manageable
- 60-74: Some corporate exposure, significant development needed
- 40-59: Limited corporate experience, high investment required
- 25-39: Academic background only, major transition risk
- 0-24: Poor match or high overqualification risk
