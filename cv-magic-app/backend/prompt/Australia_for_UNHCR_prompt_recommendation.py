### Strategic Assessment
**DECISION:** üü° STRATEGIC PURSUE

**MARKET REALITY CHECK:**
- **What they actually need:** The core must-haves for this role include strong SQL skills, experience with business intelligence tools (specifically Power BI), and the ability to manipulate and analyze data for marketing campaigns. The role also requires good stakeholder management and communication skills. The rest of the requirements, while important, are likely negotiable, especially given the organization's mission-driven focus.
  
- **Flexibility indicators:** The job description emphasizes collaboration and a values-driven approach, suggesting that they may prioritize cultural fit and adaptability over strict adherence to all technical requirements. The fact that they are a not-for-profit organization may also indicate a willingness to train candidates who show potential.

- **Hard blockers identified:** The main hard blockers could be the specific experience in SQL data warehouse environments and the need for strong project management skills. However, Maheshwor has relevant experience in data analysis and Python, which could mitigate some of these concerns.

- **Hiring urgency signals:** The job was posted in March 2025, which is relatively recent. However, the nature of the organization and the contract position may indicate a need for a quick hire, suggesting some flexibility in requirements.
