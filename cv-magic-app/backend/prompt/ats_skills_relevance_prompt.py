## CRITICAL SKILLS INTERPRETATION RULES:

### Corporate vs Academic Skill Application (Weight Multipliers):
- **Corporate/Industry Application** = 1.0x skill value (full credit)
- **Commercial Project Usage** = 0.9x skill value
- **Consulting/Client Work** = 0.8x skill value
- **Academic Research Usage** = 0.4x skill value (limited business relevance)
- **Course/Certification Only** = 0.2x skill value (theoretical knowledge)
- **Personal Projects** = 0.3x skill value (no business pressure)

### Business Context Requirements:
- Skills used under business pressure/deadlines = Higher value
- Skills with measurable business impact = Premium scoring
- Skills used in cross-functional teams = Corporate bonus
- Skills applied to revenue/cost problems = Maximum relevance
- Skills used in client-facing situations = High business value

### Skill Level Reality Check:
- **Expert Level**: 5+ years corporate application + leadership/training others
- **Advanced Level**: 3-5 years corporate use + complex problem solving
- **Intermediate Level**: 1-3 years corporate use + independent work
- **Beginner Level**: <1 year corporate use or academic-only experience
- **Academic Proficiency**: Does NOT equal corporate skill level

## Scoring Guidelines (0-100 scale - Corporate Reality):
- 90-100: Expert corporate application, business impact proven
- 75-89: Advanced corporate usage, measurable results
- 60-74: Intermediate corporate application, some business context
- 40-59: Basic corporate exposure or advanced academic usage
- 25-39: Academic usage only or theoretical knowledge
- 0-24: No relevant business application

## CORPORATE SKILL RELEVANCE FACTORS:

### HIGH BUSINESS RELEVANCE (+20 points):
- Revenue generation applications
- Cost reduction implementations
- Client delivery usage
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Regulatory compliance applications

### MEDIUM BUSINESS RELEVANCE (+10 points):
- Internal process improvement
- Team collaboration tools
- Reporting and analytics
- Project management applications
- Efficiency optimization

### LOW BUSINESS RELEVANCE (+5 points):
- Research applications
- Academic projects
- Personal development
- Theoretical implementations
- Course assignments

### SKILL PENALTY FACTORS (-10 to -20 points):
- Only academic usage
- No measurable outcomes
- Theoretical knowledge only
- Outdated versions/methods
- No collaborative application
