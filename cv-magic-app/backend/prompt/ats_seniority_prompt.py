CV TEXT: {cv_text}
JD REQUIREMENTS: {jd_text}

## CRITICAL CV INTERPRETATION RULES:

### Corporate Seniority Assessment (Primary - 80% weight):
- Full-time corporate roles = Actual seniority level
- Management experience in business = True leadership seniority
- P&L responsibility = Senior executive capability
- Client/stakeholder management = Business relationship seniority
- Budget management = Financial responsibility seniority
- Team leadership in corporate context = Management seniority
- Cross-functional project leadership = Operational seniority

### Academic Experience Seniority (Secondary - 20% weight):
- PhD research = Individual contributor level (NOT management level)
- Master's thesis = Junior individual contributor level
- Research publications = Technical competency (NOT leadership seniority)
- Academic supervision = Teaching capability (NOT business management)
- Conference presentations = Communication skills (NOT executive presence)
- Research leadership = Project management skills (NOT business leadership)
- **Note: Academic seniority rarely translates to corporate seniority**

### Seniority Reality Check:
- Corporate management > Academic leadership (5:1 ratio)
- Business results > Research publications (4:1 ratio)
- Commercial stakeholder management > Academic collaboration (3:1 ratio)
- Revenue/profit responsibility > Research funding (10:1 ratio)
- Corporate decision authority > Academic autonomy (3:1 ratio)

### Corporate Seniority Levels:
- **Entry Level**: 0-2 years corporate experience
- **Mid Level**: 3-5 years corporate experience with some leadership
- **Senior Level**: 6-10 years corporate experience with management responsibility
- **Executive Level**: 10+ years with P&L, strategic decision-making
- **Note: Academic experience alone CANNOT achieve senior/executive levels**

### Overqualification Risk Assessment:
- PhD applying for entry/mid-level = HIGH risk
- Academic background without corporate management = Mismatch for leadership roles
- Research experience without business context = Limited transferability
- Academic salary expectations vs. role level = Potential misalignment

## Scoring Guidelines (0-100 scale):
- 90-100: Excellent corporate seniority match, proven business leadership
- 75-89: Strong corporate background, minor leadership gaps
- 60-74: Some corporate seniority, significant development needed
- 40-59: Limited corporate leadership, high investment required
- 25-39: Academic background only, major seniority gap
- 0-24: Poor seniority match or high overqualification risk
