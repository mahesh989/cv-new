### Strategic Assessment
**DECISION:** üü° STRATEGIC PURSUE

---

**MARKET REALITY CHECK:**

- **What they actually need:** The core requirements for this role seem to focus on strong SQL skills, experience in data modeling, and the ability to create and maintain dashboards (especially in Power BI). While the JD lists 5+ years of experience, companies often hire candidates with less experience if they demonstrate strong potential and relevant skills.
  
- **Flexibility indicators:** The presence of "nice-to-haves" like experience with next-generation architectures suggests that they may be open to candidates who can demonstrate adaptability and a willingness to learn. The language around flexible work options and the commitment to diversity also indicates a potentially more inclusive hiring approach.

- **Hard blockers identified:** The primary hard blocker is the requirement for 5+ years of experience in data engineering, which Maheshwor does not meet. However, his strong technical background and relevant experience in data analysis and machine learning could mitigate this.

- **Hiring urgency signals:** The job description does not explicitly indicate urgency, but the detailed nature of the requirements and the emphasis on collaboration suggest that they are looking to fill this role with someone who can hit the ground running.

**INTELLIGENT OBSERVATIONS:**

- **Hidden strengths:** Maheshwor's PhD in Physics and Master's in Data Science provide a strong analytical foundation. His experience wit...
