**MARKET REALITY CHECK:**

- **What they actually need:** The role requires a strong foundation in data engineering and business intelligence, particularly in SQL and Power BI. While the JD specifies 5+ years of experience, companies often consider candidates with relevant skills and potential, especially if they can demonstrate adaptability and a willingness to learn.
  
- **Flexibility indicators:** The job description includes "nice-to-haves" such as experience with Tableau and next-generation architectures, which suggests that the company may be open to candidates who can demonstrate strong foundational skills and a willingness to learn these additional tools. The emphasis on collaboration and communication also indicates they value cultural fit and teamwork.

- **Hard blockers identified:** The primary hard blocker is the requirement for 5+ years of experience in data engineering, which Maheshwor does not meet. However, he has relevant experience in data analysis and visualization, which could be leveraged.

- **Hiring urgency signals:** The job description does not explicitly indicate urgency, but the detailed nature of the requirements suggests they are looking for someone who can hit the ground running. This could imply a need for a quick hire, which may lead to flexibility in candidate selection.
