**MARKET REALITY CHECK:**

- **What they actually need:** The core must-haves for this role are strong SQL skills, experience in building Power BI dashboards, and a solid understanding of data modeling and data warehousing principles. While they list 5+ years of experience, many companies are willing to consider candidates with slightly less experience if they demonstrate strong capabilities and adaptability.
