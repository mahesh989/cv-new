### Strategic Assessment
**DECISION:** 🟡 STRATEGIC PURSUE

---

### MARKET REALITY CHECK:

- **What they actually need:** 
  - The core requirements for this role include strong SQL skills, experience in data modeling, and the ability to create and maintain BI dashboards (particularly in Power BI). The JD suggests a preference for 5+ years of experience, but given the current market conditions and the nature of the role, they may be open to candidates with less experience if they demonstrate strong technical skills and adaptability.

- **Flexibility indicators:** 
  - The job description has a mix of strict requirements and more flexible language, such as "nice-to-haves" and a focus on collaboration and communication skills. The mention of flexible work options and a commitment to diversity indicates a willingness to consider a broader range of candidates.

- **Hard blockers identified:** 
  - The primary hard blocker is the requirement for 5+ years of experience in data engineering, particularly in designing data models and working within a data warehouse environment. However, Maheshwor has relevant experience in data analysis and Python, which could mitigate this if framed correctly.

- **Hiring urgency signals:** 
  - The urgency is implied through the detailed description of responsibilities and the emphasis on collaboration with various teams, suggesting they are looking to fill this role relatively quickly.
