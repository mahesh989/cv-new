**MARKET REALITY CHECK:**

- **What they actually need:** The core must-haves for this role are strong SQL skills, experience in building Power BI dashboards, and a solid understanding of data modeling and data warehousing principles. While they list 5+ years of experience, many companies are willing to consider candidates with slightly less experience if they demonstrate strong capabilities and adaptability.

- **Flexibility indicators:** The job description includes a lot of technical requirements, but the language around collaboration and the emphasis on communication skills suggest they value cultural fit and the ability to learn over a strict adherence to the experience requirement. The mention of "nice-to-haves" also indicates some flexibility.

- **Hard blockers identified:** The primary hard blocker could be the 5+ years of experience in data engineering, as Maheshwor has only 3 years of relevant experience. However, his strong academic background and practical experience in data analysis and machine learning could mitigate this.

- **Hiring urgency signals:** The job description does not explicitly indicate urgency, but the detailed nature of the role suggests they are looking for someone who can step in and contribute quickly, which may imply some level of urgency.
