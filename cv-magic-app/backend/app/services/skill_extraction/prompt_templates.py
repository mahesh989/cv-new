Extract SOFT SKILLS, TECHNICAL SKILLS, and DOMAIN KEYWORDS from this {document_type.lower()} and categorize them:

IMPORTANT: Only extract skills/keywords that are explicitly mentioned or have very strong textual evidence. Avoid assumptions or industry-standard inferences. Do not repeat skills/keywords that are already mentioned.

## {document_type.upper()}:
{document_text}

## SOFT SKILLS:
EXPLICIT (directly stated): List soft skills clearly mentioned
STRONGLY IMPLIED (very likely based on responsibilities): List soft skills heavily suggested with strong textual evidence

## TECHNICAL SKILLS:
EXPLICIT (directly stated): List technical skills, tools, software, qualifications clearly mentioned
STRONGLY IMPLIED (very likely based on responsibilities): List technical skills heavily suggested with strong textual evidence

## DOMAIN KEYWORDS:
EXPLICIT:  Your task is to extract **domain-specific keywords** related strictly to the **job role or functional expertise**, NOT the industry, organization, or its values.
  List **industry terms**, **role-specific language**, **tools**, **methodologies**, **compliance concepts**, and **domain knowledge** that are **directly mentioned** in the {document_type.lower()}.

STRONGLY IMPLIED:
  Your task is to extract **domain-specific keywords** related strictly to the **job role or functional expertise**, NOT the industry, organization, or its values.
  List **domain-relevant concepts** that are **heavily suggested** by the context, responsibilities, or required outputs â€” even if not explicitly named.

### DO NOT include:
- Company or organization names
- Program/service titles
- Sector-level social causes
- Values or mission statements

## CONTEXT EVIDENCE:
For each skill/keyword, provide the relevant quote from the {document_type.lower()} that supports the extraction

**CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:**
You MUST end your response with EXACTLY these three Python lists (no extra text after them):

SOFT_SKILLS = ["skill1", "skill2", "skill3"]
TECHNICAL_SKILLS = ["skill1", "skill2", "skill3"]  
DOMAIN_KEYWORDS = ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"]

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT:**
SOFT_SKILLS = ["Communication", "Leadership", "Problem-solving"]
TECHNICAL_SKILLS = ["Python", "SQL", "Tableau"]
DOMAIN_KEYWORDS = ["Data analysis", "Business intelligence", "Machine learning"]
