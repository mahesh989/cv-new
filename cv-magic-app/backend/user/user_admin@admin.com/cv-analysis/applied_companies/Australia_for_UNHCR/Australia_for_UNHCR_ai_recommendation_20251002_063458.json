Highlight any innovative solutions or significant outcomes achieved.\n\n## ‚ö†Ô∏è Strategic Warnings\n\n- **Don't Oversell:** Avoid claiming expertise in 'VBA' or 'Data Warehouse' without direct experience. Risk: High likelihood of challenge.\n- **Don't Undersell:** Highlight the PhD and Master's in Data Science as a strong analytical foundation. These are significant strengths that should be prominently featured.\n\n## üìå Section Completeness Notes\n\n- **Missing Sections:** The CV may lack a dedicated 'Projects' or 'Volunteer Experience' section, which could be beneficial for showcasing relevant experience in the not-for-profit sector.\n- **Suggestions for Improvement:** Consider integrating relevant projects or volunteer experiences into existing sections like 'Experience' or 'Education'. This can provide context and demonstrate alignment with the organization's mission.\n\n---\n\n**Strategic Note:** This analysis is based on comprehensive data including actual ATS calculations, component analysis, and strategic assessment. Focus on evidence-based improvements that maximize authenticity while optimizing for ATS performance and interview success.",
