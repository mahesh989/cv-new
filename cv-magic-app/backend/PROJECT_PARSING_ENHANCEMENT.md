# Project Parsing Enhancement - University Context Integration

## Problem Identified
The thesis project was missing critical information:
- **Company field was empty** - should show "Charles Darwin University"
- **Duration was empty** - should show "Mar 2023 - Oct 2024" (Master's degree period)
- **Limited technology extraction** - missing relevant keywords

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Project Parsing with Education Context
Created `_text_to_projects_array_with_context()` method that:

1. **Uses Education Context**: 
   - Identifies Master's degree for thesis projects
   - Uses university name as "company" field
   - Uses degree duration for project timeline

2. **Improved Technology Extraction**:
   - Expanded keyword list: YOLOv8, YOLO, Object Detection, Fine-tuning, etc.
   - Better pattern matching in project descriptions

3. **Better Project Association**:
   - Thesis projects → linked to Master's degree institution
   - Dated projects → linked to appropriate educational period

## Results

### Before Enhancement:
```json
{
  "name": "Thesis",
  "duration": "",
  "company": "",
  "description": "Optimisation of Yolov8n Model...",
  "technologies": ["YOLOv8", "Pruning"],
  "achievements": ["Grade: 89/100"]
}
```

### After Enhancement:
```json
{
  "name": "Thesis",
  "duration": "Mar 2023 - Oct 2024",
  "company": "Charles Darwin University",
  "description": "Optimisation of Yolov8n Model...",
  "technologies": ["YOLOv8", "YOLO", "Pruning", "Object Detection", "Fine-tuning"],
  "achievements": ["Grade: 89/100"]
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Context Extraction Logic:
```python
# Find the most recent degree (likely Master's for thesis work)
master_degree = None
bachelor_degree = None

for edu in education:
    degree_text = edu.get('degree', '').lower()
    if 'master' in degree_text or 'masters' in degree_text:
        master_degree = edu
    elif 'bachelor' in degree_text:
        bachelor_degree = edu

# Use master's degree as default context, fallback to bachelor's
university_context = master_degree or bachelor_degree
```

### Thesis Project Enhancement:
```python
# For thesis projects, use university context
if 'thesis' in name_part.lower() and university_context:
    project_entry["company"] = university_context.get('institution', '')
    project_entry["duration"] = university_context.get('duration', '')
```

### Enhanced Technology Keywords:
```python
tech_keywords = [
    'Python', 'SQL', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning', 'YOLOv8', 'YOLO',
    'Logistic Regression', 'Random Forest', 'Pruning', 'TensorFlow', 
    'PyTorch', 'Visualization', 'Data Analysis', 'Neural Networks',
    'Computer Vision', 'Object Detection', 'Fine-tuning'
]
```

## Final Results Summary

| Project | Company | Duration | Technologies | Achievements |
|---------|---------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Thesis | Charles Darwin University | Mar 2023 - Oct 2024 | 5 technologies | Grade: 89/100 |
| Heart Attack Risk Prediction | Charles Darwin University | Oct 2024 | 3 technologies | Grade: 37/40 |

### Performance Metrics:
- ✅ **Projects with university context**: 2/2 (100%)
- ✅ **Projects with duration**: 2/2 (100%) 
- ✅ **Total technologies extracted**: 8 (vs 2 previously)
- ✅ **Context accuracy**: Both projects correctly linked to Master's degree

## Benefits

1. **Complete Project Information**: All projects now have proper university/company attribution
2. **Accurate Timelines**: Project durations properly extracted from education context
3. **Enhanced Technology Detection**: 4x more technologies identified
4. **Better Data Structure**: Projects now fully structured and queryable
5. **Academic Context**: Clear link between academic projects and educational institution

## Files Modified

- **`app/services/structured_cv_parser.py`** - Added education context integration
- **`cv-analysis/original_cv.json`** - Updated with enhanced project data
