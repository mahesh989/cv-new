# ATS Calculator Table Format Fix

## Issue Description
The ATS calculator was returning 0.0 for all Category 1 match rates, causing incorrect low ATS scores (around 50.56 instead of expected 76+).

## Root Cause
The preextracted comparison data format changed from individual labeled lines to a table format:

### Old Format (Expected by ATS Calculator)
```
Technical Skills Match Rate: 100%
Soft Skills Match Rate: 35.71%
Domain Keywords Match Rate: 72.73%
```

### New Format (Actual Output)
```
ðŸ“Š SUMMARY TABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Category              CV Total  JD Total   Matched   Missing  Match Rate (%)
Technical Skills            18          7           7           0          100.00
Soft Skills                   5         14           5           9           35.71
Domain Keywords             18         22          16           6           72.73
```

## Solution
Updated the `_calculate_match_rates` method in `/app/services/ats/ats_score_calculator.py` to:

1. Parse table rows by splitting on whitespace
2. Extract match rate from the last column
3. Extract missing count from the second-to-last column
4. Handle both table format and detailed analysis sections

## Code Changes
The key changes in the `_calculate_match_rates` method:
- Added logic to detect table rows containing "Technical Skills", "Soft Skills", or "Domain Keywords"
- Split lines by whitespace and extract values from appropriate columns
- Added error handling for parsing failures
- Maintained backward compatibility with detailed analysis sections

## Test Results
After the fix:
- Technical Skills Match Rate: 100% âœ“
- Soft Skills Match Rate: 35.71% âœ“
- Domain Keywords Match Rate: 72.73% âœ“
- Final ATS Score: 76.78 (Good fit - Worth an interview)

## Test Script
A test script `test_ats_table_parsing.py` was created to verify the fix works correctly with the new table format.

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
1. ATS scores are calculated correctly based on actual skill matches
2. Category 1 scores properly reflect the CV-JD alignment
3. Frontend displays accurate ATS scores to users
