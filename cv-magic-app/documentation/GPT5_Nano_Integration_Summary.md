# GPT-5 Nano Model Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated GPT-5 Nano model into the CV Magic application with `service_tier="flex"` configuration, ensuring it works consistently with the existing centralized AI model system and uses proper OpenAI API parameters.

## Changes Made

### Frontend (Flutter - mobile_app)

1. **AI Model Configuration** (`lib/models/ai_model.dart`)
   - Added GPT-5 Nano to the `availableModels` map
   - Configured with OpenAI provider
   - Set as recommended nano model with flexible service tier
   - Assigned neon color theme and bolt icon
   - Added capabilities: Text, Code, Analysis, Fast Processing, Flexible

2. **AI Model Service** (`lib/services/ai_model_service.dart`)
   - Added GPT-5 Nano to backend model name mapping
   - Ensures proper communication with backend API

### Backend (Python - FastAPI)

1. **AI Configuration** (`app/ai/ai_config.py`)
   - Added GPT-5 Nano ModelConfig with:
     - Provider: OpenAI
     - Max tokens: 200,000
     - Input cost: $0.00005/1k tokens
     - Output cost: $0.0002/1k tokens
     - Description: Latest nano model with flexible service tier

2. **OpenAI Provider** (`app/ai/providers/openai_provider.py`)
   - Added GPT-5 Nano to available models list
   - Added `service_tier="flex"` parameter for nano models
   - Increased timeout to 900 seconds (15 minutes) for nano models
   - Added model information for cost calculation and metadata

## Centralized AI System Features

The application uses a centralized AI model system where:

### Model Selection
- Users can select any AI model from the homepage
- Selection is persisted across sessions
- Model change is immediately synced with backend

### Consistent Usage
- Selected model is used throughout all API calls
- Results are saved with model metadata
- Model information is displayed in analysis results

### Pipeline Results Display
- Results are displayed in the `SkillsDisplayWidget`
- Shows analysis results with AI model used
- Includes execution time and cost information
- Supports expandable detailed analysis sections

## Verification

✅ Backend configuration successfully loads GPT-5-nano-flex model  
✅ Frontend Flutter analysis passes without issues  
✅ Model appears in available models list  
✅ Centralized system ensures consistent model usage  
✅ Pipeline results are properly displayed in mobile app frontend  

## Usage

1. **Model Selection**: Users can select GPT-5-nano-flex from the AI model selector in the homepage
2. **Consistency**: Once selected, GPT-5-nano-flex will be used for all AI operations
3. **Results**: Analysis results will show GPT-5-nano-flex as the model used
4. **Performance**: Benefits from flexible adaptive performance and very low cost

## Technical Notes

- GPT-5-nano-flex is configured as a recommended model with "Very Fast" speed and "Very Low" cost
- Features flexible adaptive performance capabilities for various workloads
- Uses the same API integration pattern as other GPT models
- Supports all standard OpenAI chat completion features
- Model switching is handled gracefully with user feedback

The integration follows the existing pattern established by GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5-turbo, and DeepSeek models, ensuring consistency and reliability.
